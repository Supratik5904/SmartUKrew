# SmartUKrew
48 Hours Sample POC Project for creating a Smart Assistant to answer various queries
UKrewers Assistant - Solution for Enginnering Team

 

The goal of this project is to address the various challenges faced by 
-- UKG customers 
-- New Hire and other cross domain teams
-- Engineers (Architect, Developement Teams)
-- Product owners 
To achieve this, we will be implementing a friendly yet powerful help utility with the usage of OpenaAI model and Meta LLMs that will help the users in their daily life.

 

Ultimately, this project aims to ensure that all of our customers and engineers have access to the resources and support they need to fully understand and effectively utilize our products, while minimizing any potential integration issues or conflicts. We can ensure a better customer experience and more successful outcomes for all. 

 

We can plan to replace existing help section in customer environments with this new AI advanced solutions to them, which is also cost effective instead on using any third party help based on SEO only.


Aspects which we achieved:

 

1. Meta LLM implementation using Python Scripts
2. Context Searching Enabled in search platform
3. Connect with different other small scale sources like WordPress, PDFs used in Kronos as training data sets for this utility.  


 

Aspects which we need to work upon:

 

1.We will use https://llamahub.ai/ connectors for connecting to the data sources to UKG repositories - These connectors include Confluence (Created by Domain Owners/SME's), BitBucket (Code-Snippets), API Devportal Documentations for cross domains and other UKG guides.


2. Add it as a plugin in browser (Future Scope) access for UKrewers only which they authenticate to access other documentation and resources so that everyone can have access to information for learning.

Setting Up in Your Local:
For this project to work in your local, you have to create a directory path as “Documents” and you can keep as many documents as possible in there from your confluence or other sources. Open your command prompt and run the “smartUkrew.py” file and once it starts on port launch your html file in the browser and you can ask it different kind of questions related to your data set. It can be code snippets or technical queries or even product functionalities.
